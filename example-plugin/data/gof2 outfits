	description "Stealth generators have been a staple for merchants and pirates for their various uses, from a quick escape to a unexpected ambush. Dr. Kobus Mutkin's Yin Co. stealth generator completely revolutionizes the previous function of stealth generators, allowing ships to stay cloaked for hours. However, the generator has a long start up, loosing the appeal for merchants escaping ambushes and appealing only to mercenaries awaiting long ambushes."
