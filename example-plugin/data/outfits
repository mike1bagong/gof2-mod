 	description "The well-known myth that the Berger Retribution was an attempt to remedy the infamously slow reload times of the Converge series by having two barrels was a lie. In reality, the Berger company used two barrels to balance heat distribution. The myth was spread so well throughout the galaxy that the Berger company had to spend millions of credits to inform the truth of the unusual design."
